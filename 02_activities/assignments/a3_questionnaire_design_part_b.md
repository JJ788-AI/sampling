# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The quality and representativeness of a sample depend on whether it captures the diversity of the target population. I might expect the representative of the sample might be partically, as if it is not carefully stratified or systematically collected, certain groups may be over or under represented. 
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
1. write your question here...
What is your current employement status with the company?
a.current employed with the company
b.no longer employed with the company 
2. write your question here...
How long have you been working in your current role at the company?
a. less than 6 months 
b. 6 months to 1 year
c. 1-2 years
d. more than 2 years
3. write your question here...
How would you rate the level of support and communication you receive from your direct supervisor/manager?
a.very poor
b.poor
c.average
d.good
c.excellent
4. write your question here...
Do you feel that there are enough opportunities for you career growth within the company?
a.yes
b.no
c.Not sure
Added "Not sure" option in Question 4
Original: Do you feel that there are sufficient opportunities for career growth within the company? (Yes/No/I don't know)
Revised: Do you feel that there are sufficient opportunities for career growth within the company? (Yes/No/Not sure)
Reason: "I don't know" might sound dismissive or imply a lack of thought. "Not sure" is clearer and provides a neutral option for respondents who genuinely cannot decide, reducing the risk of forced or invalid answers.
5. write your question here...
How would you recommend the company to others?
a.very positive
b.mostly positive
c.neutral
d.mostly negative
e.very negative
Changed wording in Question 5 to "How likely are you to recommend the company":
Original: How would you recommend the company to others?
Revised: How likely are you to recommend the company as a place to work to others?
Reason: The original phrasing was ambiguous, making it unclear whether respondents were being asked about their general opinion or their likelihood of recommending the company. The revised wording aligns with common survey standards (e.g., Net Promoter Score), ensuring clarity and better comparability with benchmarks.
6. write your question here... (optional)
What suggestions or imporvement would you say to reduce the employee turenover ?
#
7. write your question here... (optional)
What were the main factors that influenced your decision to leave the company (if applicable)? (Select all that apply)
a.Lack of career advancement opportunities
b.Low compensation
c.Poor work-life balance
d.Lack of recognition or appreciation
e.Poor relationship with direct supervisor
f.Job dissatisfaction or lack of interest in the role
g.Limited professional development or training
h.Other (please specify)
    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    It could not be fully fulfilled through an observational study alone. Observational studies involve analyzing behavior or patterns without direclty interacting with participants. However survey seeks to understand the subjective experience and thses are internal and cannot be observed directly. Especailly with the reason for leaving, observational methods can not capture therse personal factors. 
    ```
